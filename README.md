The parts will be listed in a later update.
- __UPDATE (08/07/2023)__
  
      The Firmware currently has the LCD handler setup and the design process
      will begin momentarily for the interface of the apparatus.

      The LVGL Library is currently being implemented to help design the GUI
      for its purposes.
- __The Drivers for the display are a GC9A01 SPI and a CST816S I2C Touch Interface__
