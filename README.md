# Digital-Pocket-Watch
This is my first invention which implements functionality for time, obviously, and a connection to a remote camera server.

The parts are all in the mainv2/Footprints. A list here will be provided later.
- __UPDATE (10/01/2023)__
  
      The Firmware currently supports all fudamental rpotocols (I2C, WIFI, SPI, etc.)
      It also has the UI implemented for basic functionality,. Server setup for camera
      display is the only part left, but the lack of ability to manufacture it from costs
      could leave this project as is, finished.
- __The Drivers for the display are a GC9A01 SPI and a CST816S I2C Touch Interface__
